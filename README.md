# Zero2Prod

A Project exploring the use of Rust for Cloud Native API development.
This will be done by creating a news letter service that can be integrated into a blog / website

## Features/User stories
- As the author, I want to be able to send an email to everyone in the list
- As the reader, I want to be able to subscribe to recieve all emails from the author
- As the reader, I want to be able to unsubscribe from all emails from an author

## Goals
- Setup a comfortable and quick development loop
- Setup a CI pipeline from the start which would include:
  - compiling
  - linting
  - formatting
  - auditing for vulnerabilities
  - and MOST IMPORTANTLY testing
